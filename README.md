Hello! My name is Liam. I work at [TYT](https://tyt.com) in the daytime and am 
hacking away at my broadcast software startup [Astronaut Labs](https://astronautlabs.com)
in the night time hours. I am passionate about all things media, especially 
audio and video systems. I have over ten years of experience as a software engineer
and have worked on projects in many domains like health care, printshops, 
SMS marketing, and of course, lots and lots of media, both on the consumer side 
as well as professional media production tooling.

I have been in the open source community for at least fifteen years,
and have contributed code to a number of smaller projects, like Slicker 
(KDE Kicker replacement), SharpOS (a hobbyist OS written in C#). I have 
participated in community discussions in Mono (an open source .NET implementation),
X.org, and KDE. I also have a number of open source projects that I'm actively 
developing today.

# my politics

I am a politics junkie. I am unabashedly progressive. I participate in 
Democratic Socialists of America, I stand with Black Lives Matter, and I vote.
I supported Bernie Sanders in 2016 and 2020. As you can imagine, my work at 
TYT is very satisfying for me. Fun fact: I got to meet Alexandria
Ocasio Cortez in person when she came on The Young Turks some time after she 
won her primary and before she won the general election in 2018! 

# my projects
- [devtools](https://github.com/rezonant/devtools) -- All your devtools in one place
- [poker](https://github.com/rezonant/poker) -- A simple standalone planning poker app
- [sliptap](https://sliptap.com) -- Sliptap is a search engine focusing on media. 
  Sliptap is constantly crawling the web and building an index of the world's media
  using JSON-LD and OpenGraph metadata.
- [@astronautlabs/diazo](https://github.com/astronautlabs/diazo) -- Diazo is a 
  directed acyclical graph editor component for Angular in the style of Unreal
  Engine's Blueprint system. It can be used for lots of domains and use cases!
- [@astronautlabs/scte104](https://github.com/astronautlabs/scte104) -- As part
  of our work at Astronaut Labs I have built an open source implementation of the 
  SCTE 104 client/server signaling protocol. As far as I know, it is the only 
  open source implementation of SCTE 104 made for Node.js.
- [alterior](https://github.com/alterior-mvc/alterior) -- Alterior is an 
  application framework that primarily facilitates Node.js server 
  applications of all types. It uses a dependency injection system that is similar
  to Angular, and you can even create libraries that can be consumed both in Alterior
  apps (backend) and Angular (frontend) apps, making it isomorphic.
- [razmin](https://github.com/rezonant/razmin) -- Razmin is a new take on the 
  classic Jasmine/Mocha style test framework, but modernized to match Typescript 
  conventions and using Zone.js to make testing asynchronous code simpler and more 
  reliable.

# my stack

Over the years I have honed my preferred toolset quite a lot. Find below a list 
of components that I use (in addition to my libraries above) for almost every 
project. I've worked with many alternatives to the tech listed below, but I've 
found these solutions pack the best punch.

- [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) -- There was a time where I
  was not a fan of Windows, but through years of working with the Windows stack,
  especially .NET/C#, I have grown to appreciate its power. I use Windows for all
  of my desktop computing, and I do all of my development on Windows. I also have 
  a good amount of experience administering enterprise Windows deployments including
  Windows Server (ActiveDirectory, Domains, SQL Server / IIS / ASP.NET)
- [Linux](https://kernel.org) -- Though I do my development on Windows, I deploy
  on Linux. I have been using Linux since circa 2003, and my first Linux distribution
  was Slackware, which I learned on my own as an angsty nerdy teenager. I have 
  a deep understanding of Linux' architecture, having built experimental distributions 
  based on Linux for fun.
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) -- Abstract cloud native applications is today's reality.
- [Linode](https://cloud.google.com) -- Deploy your Kubernetes workloads here
- [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org/) -- When I was introduced to Typescript 
  with Angular 2, I fell in love. Fast forward to now (Angular 10 was just released)
  and I now use Typescript exclusively when building browser apps and Node.js services.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) -- I default to Node.js when building new server-side 
  services, because I believe that the benefits of one language across frontend and 
  backend is the most important consideration. 
- [Rust](https://rustlang.org) -- When Node.js isn't performant/low-level/etc enough, 
  I reach for Rust.
- [Angular](https://angular.io) -- I have been writing apps in Angular since Angular 2
  beta (circa December 2015), and I was using AngularJS before that. I am enthusiastic
  and strongly invested in Angular as a platform, and I really love building apps with it 
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io) -- The Google Material Design implementation
    for Angular, Angular Material provides a rich suite of user interface controls that rarely
    leaves me wanting.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) -- I spend most of my day in front of 
  VS Code and so should you!
- [zone.js](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/zone.js) -- Zone.js is one 
  of the most powerful libraries in my stack. A lot of the libraries I've built use it for 
  one reason or another. 

# side projects
- [streamatik](https://streamatik.com) -- Streamatik is a good looking Twitch multi-viewer.
- [rezone](https://github.com/rezonant/rezonae) -- I ❤️ zone.js, but I believe its 
  API is difficult to use and somewhat overcomplicated. Zone.js also needs to 
  become part of ECMAScript in order to continue working as new features like 
  native async/await grow in usage, but standardization efforts have stalled for 
  a number of reasons. Rezone aims to tackle both of these issues, creating a 
  simpler, easier to use, and more intuitive API for zones, as well as proposes 
  that its API become part of the ECMAScript standard, picking up where [Domenic
  Denicola's Zones proposal](https://github.com/domenic/zones/tree/eb65c6d43b452a877c24561cd64c6901e790ecf0) left off
